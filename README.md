# Golang and WebSockets Chat

This is a simple example of implementing a chat web app using Go and WebSockets. As it is implemented it is less like a peer-to-peer chat and more like a chat room. Just and exercise in proof of design competency of a web app. The application does require a DynamoDB data-store with the requisite table which is not created within the code.

An instance of the application is running at: http://54.166.9.98:8080/chat
